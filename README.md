StrangeBrew Android Application for StrangeBrew Elsinore Server


Setting Up
==========
Please refer to [Elsinore Server](https://github.com/DougEdey/SB_Elsinore_Server) for the Server side setup

I have a basic Android app uploaded as well: [Elsinore APK](https://github.com/DougEdey/SB_Elsinore_Android/bin/Elsinore.apk)

![Android App Temp](https://github.com/DougEdey/SB_Elsinore_Server/raw/master/img/Temp_Elsinore.png)

I've designed it to run on Nexus 7 tablets using Android 4.0.4+ Settings are simple, just setting the hostname/port at the moment, with a refresh rate.

There's a basic timer, I'll be adding alerts in soon.

Since this is early days development, it must be expected that there will be bugs! But please file a bug report, or better yet, a bug fix with a pull request.
